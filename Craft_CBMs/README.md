# Craftable CBMs mod, for Cataclysm: Bright Nights. Allows for the player to craft CBMs, and removes the need to sterilize them.

This mod re-introduces features from older versions of Cataclysm that are not currently present in vanilla Bright Nights, pertaining to bionics. See Changes Made below for a full list, and also see Important Notes if you intend to use this with Aftershock.

To install, place the included Craft_CBMs folder in your data/mods folder. It is recommended that, when updating the mod, you delete the older version of the folder rather than just dumping the new one onto the old one. This will avoid issues that may be caused should any files be renamed, moved, or deleted.

## Changes Made

* The following CBMs have been given the recipes they had in older versions of Cataclysm:
  - Aero-Evaporator CBM
  - Arms Alloy Plating CBM
  - Battery System CBM
  - Cranial Flashlight CBM
  - Head Alloy Plating CBM
  - Legs Alloy Plating CBM
  - Power Armor Interface CBM
  - Power Armor Mk. II Interface CBM
  - Power Storage CBM
  - Power Storage CBM Mk. II
  - Torso Alloy Plating CBM
  - Unified Power System CBM
  - Water Extraction Unit CBM

* Power Storage CBM and Power Storage CBM Mk. II can be disassembled, yielding the same components they did in older versions.

* Vanilla harvest entries edited, changing all standard bionic spawns to not require packing and sterilization, making them ready-to-install immediately like they were in older versions.

## Important Notes

This mod will clash somewhat if combined with Aftershock, as both mods add recipes for CBMs. If you want to use both mods, make sure to add this mod to your mod list after adding Aftershock, so this mod's overrides will take precedence on load order. CBMs that have a recipe in Aftershock but not in this mod will still use Aftershock's specialized exotic materials.

This mod is currently only in development for BN. If the current version is loaded into Dark Days Ahead, it will fail to load due to differences in the recipe JSON between the two games. Separate version for use in DDA may be added in the future if requested.
